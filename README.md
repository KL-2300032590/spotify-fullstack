# 🎵 Antara – Full Stack Spotify Clone (Free & Premium Music App)

**Antara** (अंतरा) is a full-stack music streaming web application, inspired by Spotify — but designed with *freedom, creativity, and accessibility* in mind.  
The word **Antara** comes from Indian classical music, symbolizing *depth* and *discovery* — just like the musical journeys inside this platform.
